Teenage Mutant Ninja Shell
==========================

This is a Unix shell I wrote for an assignment in COMP2300, "Introduction to
Computer Systems" at the Australian National University in Semester 1, 2011.

I met all the basic criteria for the assignment and implemented a number of
extensions, gaining an overall grade of 99%.
